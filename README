Purpose: 
Determine if a Twitter user has another user in thier 1st, 2nd or 
3rd degree of connections
Limitations: 
Running 3rd degree checks on users that have a lot of followers/friends 
will result in using all your available API hit. Twitter developer 
account recommended!

Usage: twitmap.rb <twit1> <twit2> 
Result: Will show connections between nodes. E.g.: brookr -> tj

Example: 
> ./twitmap.rb brookr laughingsquid
 brookr -> carlosdavis -> laughingsquid
> ./twitmap.rb sarahr pop17
 sarahr -> brookr -> WhitScott -> pop17

History:
2009-05-26: 
Version .1: "We might have something here"
 – Now checks the 3rd degree as intended
 – Various optimizations to reduce API hits
 – Refactorings!

2009-02-20:
Version 0.0.1: "Proof of concept"
 – Checks first and second degree
 – Uses lots of API hits
 – But keeps track of those API hits used!
